DocumentOCR is a web application that extracts text from scanned documents and images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Users can upload PDFs or images, choose between fast local processing (Tesseract) or AI-powered extraction (LLM via OpenRouter), and edit the extracted text in a rich text editor. The app features a React frontend with a FastAPI backend, both containerized with Docker.
